Description:
    The generator takes a model name as its argument.  The model name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Model'.

    The generator creates a model class in app/models, a login controller in
    app/controller, and a migration in db/migrate.

Example:
    ./script/generate lwt_authentication_system

    This will create:
        Model:      app/models/user.rb
        Controller  app/controller/users_controller.rb
        Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_lwt_authentication_system.rb
